# Overview

I created this project in order to learn the Java programming language, as well as to challenge myself to create a complex program in a programming language I had no prior experience in.

I created a commandline text-based video game, and I implemented the use of a custom functions, loops, conditionals, and general syntax, as well as learning about HashMaps and how to implement them properly into the code.

I wrote this program so that I can learn Java, and practice, as well as learn a little bit about game design and everything possible with my game.
